	<h1>Hello world</h1>
	<h2>☆ Who is Clara? </h2>
	<p>I am Clara, a 21-year-old student at Kedge Business School where I am pursuing a Master's degree in Marketing Digital and Sales. As a creative individual with a passion for music, spending time with friends, surfing, and watching sunsets, I bring a unique perspective to my studies. Additionally, my love for animals only adds to my unique personality traits.

Apart from my interests, I consider myself to be a spontaneous and shy person, which I believe makes me a valuable asset to any team or project I work on.</p>
